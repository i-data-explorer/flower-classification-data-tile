## Iris Flower Classification

![Iris](/_images/iris-image-1.jpg)

Iris flower dataset contains 50 instances of 3 classes of Iris plants(Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor & Iris-virginica)
Goal of Iris flower classification problem is to classify an unseen Iris flower into the three distinct sub-species.
Keras and Tensorflow is used to develop a feed-forward neural network model for this multi-class classification problem.
Finally, the model is evaluated using kfold cross validation method, present in the scikit-learn library.

An average accuracy of 95% is observed
